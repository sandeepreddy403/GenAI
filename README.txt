Walmart is one of the largest players in the retail industry, known for its vast range of products, including groceries, electronics, and home goods. The company’s strategic focus centers around maintaining an efficient supply chain, offering competitive pricing, and enhancing customer satisfaction. With Walmart's online presence and digital initiatives, the company is well-positioned to integrate AI-driven solutions to further strengthen its operations and customer service.

Architecture Overview:
This project employs a multi-agent system to analyze Walmart’s current market position, generate AI/GenAI use cases, and collect relevant resource links. The architecture consists of four main agents:
1. Industry Research Agent : Gathers insights on the retail industry’s competitive landscape and Walmart’s key offerings.
2. Market Standards & Use Case Generation Agent : Utilizes the gathered industry and company data to generate tailored AI and GenAI use cases, which are expected to address Walmart's operational goals.
3. Resource Asset Collection Agent : Searches for relevant resources (models and datasets) on Hugging Face and GitHub to support the proposed use cases.
4. Report Compilation Agent : Assembles findings into a structured report, including generated use cases, resource links, and company insights.

Technical Workflow:
The multi-agent system operates in the following sequence:
1. Data Collection: Inputs, including Walmart’s offerings and strategic focus, as well as general industry information, are entered.
2. LLM-Powered Use Case Generation: An LLM (GPT-Neo) processes the input data to suggest potential AI applications that could enhance Walmart’s operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
3. Resource Link Retrieval: The system searches Hugging Face and GitHub for relevant models or datasets related to retail AI applications. Specific searches include terms like “retail demand forecasting AI,” “customer recommendation system,” “inventory optimization AI,” and “retail chatbot AI.”
4. Report Compilation: The findings are compiled into a structured report, ready for analysis and potential implementation.

Industry Insights:
The retail sector remains highly competitive, with a continuous focus on enhancing digital capabilities and supply chain management. For Walmart, these insights align with its ongoing strategic initiatives aimed at strengthening online retail, optimizing logistics, and delivering competitive pricing.

Generated AI and GenAI Use Cases:
The following use cases were generated for Walmart’s operational goals:

1. Inventory Optimization: AI-based models can analyze historical sales and current inventory to maintain optimal stock levels, reducing waste and improving availability.
2. Customer Recommendation Systems: Personalized recommendations for online shoppers based on browsing history and past purchases can drive sales and enhance the customer experience.
3. Sentiment Analysis for Customer Feedback: Using NLP to analyze customer feedback from social media, reviews, and surveys can provide Walmart with insights into customer sentiment and preferences.
4. Retail Chatbot: AI-powered chatbots can assist in customer service, handling inquiries efficiently and providing information on products and orders.
5. Demand Forecasting: Leveraging predictive models to forecast retail demand helps in preparing for seasonal peaks and managing supply chain dynamics effectively.

Resource Link Collection:
The system encountered limitations in retrieving relevant resources from Hugging Face and GitHub due to constraints in API access and search specificity. However, alternative search terms and direct searches for datasets or models relevant to the above use cases may improve link retrieval accuracy.
